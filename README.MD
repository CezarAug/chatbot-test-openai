# OpenAI Integration exercise (Ecomart)

Using a project from Alura as a starting point, this is just an exercise on how to connect with OpenAI APIs and communicate, wihtout having any other purposes such as being a full production-ready application.

While the original project was created with theokanning's open-ai Java, this version was developed since the beginning with the official OpenAI Java library.

Other extra changes were made, such as having both sync and async clients.

## How to Run

 - Just provide the environment variables:
   - OpenAI Library mandatory environment variables:
     - OPENAI_PROJECT_ID
     - OPENAI_API_KEY
     - OPENAI_ORG_ID
   - Create your assistant with OpenAI's playground and provide the id:
